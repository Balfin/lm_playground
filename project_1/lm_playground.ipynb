        "Welcome to your first project! In this project, you'll build a simple large language model (LLM) playground, an interactive environment where you can experiment with LLMs and understand how they work under the hood.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal here is to understand the foundations and mechanics behind LLMs rather than relying on higher-level abstractions or frameworks. You'll see what happens “under the hood”, how an LLM receives a text, processes it, and generate a response. In later projects, you'll use frameworks like Ollama and LangChain that simplify many of these steps. But before that, this project will help you build a solid mental model of how LLMs actually work.\n",
