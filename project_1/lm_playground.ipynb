        "The goal here is to understand the foundations and mechanics behind LLMs rather than relying on higher-level abstractions or frameworks. You'll see what happens “under the hood”, how an LLM receives a text, processes it, and generate a response. In later projects, you'll use frameworks like Ollama and LangChain that simplify many of these steps. But before that, this project will help you build a solid mental model of how LLMs actually work.\n",

        "### Q&A\n",
        "The LLM playground UI has been successfully implemented and is interactive, allowing users to select models, adjust parameters, and generate text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The GPT-2 and Qwen models along with their respective tokenizers were pre-loaded into the environment, fulfilling the initial requirement for model availability.\n",
        "*   A `generate_text` helper function was successfully defined, capable of handling text generation for both GPT-2 and Qwen models using appropriate tokenization and supporting greedy, top-k, and top-p decoding strategies.\n",
        "*   All necessary UI elements, including a text input for prompts, dropdowns for model and strategy selection, sliders for generation parameters (`max_new_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`), and a \"Generate Text\" button, were successfully created using `ipywidgets`.\n",
        "*   An event handler was implemented for the \"Generate Text\" button, which correctly retrieves user inputs from the UI, calls the `generate_text` function with the selected parameters, and displays the generated output.\n",
        "*   The interactive LLM playground UI was successfully displayed in the Colab environment, demonstrating full functionality and user interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current interactive playground provides a robust environment for rapid prototyping and comparison of different LLM configurations and models (GPT-2, Qwen) under various decoding strategies.\n",
        "*   Further enhancements could include adding more pre-trained LLMs, implementing advanced output formatting, or integrating features for comparing generated texts side-by-side.\n"
